<h1> My Cause and its Misconceptions </h1>
<h2> My Cause </h2>
<p> My cause is my family this is because I want to be able to repay them for all things that they helped me with. I also don't want to let them down; I want to be a role model for my brother and sister as they begin to look at college and go on in their lives as well. </p>
<h2> Misconceptions </h2>
<ul>
<li> Leaving my family would cause me to lose my drive </li>
<li> I am too close to my family </li>
</ul>
<h2> My Truth </h2>
<p> I won't lose my drive when I leave my family because when I leave them I think about them even more. Once I think about them more and more the more it pushes me to keep striving to be great. The love and desire to please them and make them happy pushes me to reach my full potential every day. </p>
